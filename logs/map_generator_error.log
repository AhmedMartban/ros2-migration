[0.245s] WARNING:colcon.colcon_ros.prefix_path.catkin:The path '/home/ahmo030/arena_ws/devel' in the environment variable CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH seems to be a catkin workspace but it doesn't contain any 'local_setup.*' files. Maybe the catkin version is not up-to-date?
--- stderr: map_generator
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmap_distance_server.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "map_distance_server", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "map_distance_server" with any of the following names:

    map_distance_serverConfig.cmake
    map_distance_server-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "map_distance_server" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "map_distance_server_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "map_distance_server" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
