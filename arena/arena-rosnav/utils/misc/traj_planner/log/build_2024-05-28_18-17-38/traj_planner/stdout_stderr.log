CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpath_search.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "path_search", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "path_search" with
  any of the following names:

    path_searchConfig.cmake
    path_search-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "path_search" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "path_search_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "path_search" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
